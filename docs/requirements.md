# Requirements
This project needs to demonstrate automatic token refresh functionality.  The specific details of the token refresh mechanism are not defined in the prompt, so this documentation will outline general requirements for such a system:

* **Token Expiration:** The system should have a defined token expiration time.
* **Refresh Logic:** Clear logic should be implemented to refresh the token before expiration.
* **Storage:** Secure storage of the token is essential.
* **UI Integration:**  The refresh mechanism should not disrupt the user experience.
